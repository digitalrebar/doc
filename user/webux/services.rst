Services
========

The "Services" tab will not open a page, but will provide the options of "Rule Engine", "DHCP Subnets," and "DNS Zones."

Rule Engine
-----------

The "Rule Engine" is a read-only view that displays active rules. This information is for advanced developers. 

DHCP Subnets
------------

The "DHCP Subnet" page shows network configurations.  The page shows the network name and the subnet that is employed by the network.  The DHCP also provides IP addresses that to be leased or bound to nodes.  The leased and bound nodes and IPs can be seen on the page, along with options for the DHCP.

**Extra Info**: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used to hand out addressed to admin networks, and also tells the nodes to boot OS's from the provisioner. 

DNS Zones
---------

The "DNS Zones" page displays the current DNS Zones.
This maps the space from names to IP addresses and back.
The Zone shows the current map that Digital Rebar is making on behalf of nodes.
This includes IPv4 A records and IPv6 AAAA records.



**Note**: By default, only the admin network has entrance.
