Overview
========

At Digital Rebar, we not only strive to provide excellent deployment services, but an excellent user experience.  In order to satisfy that imperative, we have developed a new user interface.  
The new interface provides a sleek, new way to interact with server deployment, and has been designed with efficiency in mind.  


Upon logging in, the user interface will open to the Deployments page.  The top of every page is dominated by this header:

The name of the selected page is posted on the left, while the tenant is displayed to the right.
The three icons are for refreshing data, viewing the :ref:`ux_annealer`, and viewing the welcome screen documentation respectively.  Thanks to the data refresher, users should not need to refresh the page.
