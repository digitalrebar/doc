Barclamps
=========

Barclamps contain roles and attributes that can be added to Digital Rebar.  They are the primary way that roles are created in the system.  By design, they can be managed independently without becoming part of the core project.

Core Project Barclamps
----------------------

Digital Rebar Core has many barclamps that are required for the system operations.  They are listed in the `Core Barclamps <https://github.com/digitalrebar/digitalrebar/tree/master/core/barclamps>`_ directory

Barclamp Details
----------------

Since barclamps are primarily holders for other data, there is minimal information associated with a barclamp.

Editing Barclamps
-----------------

It is possible to add or edit barclamps as JSON files from the UI.  Due to the complexity of the options, only JSON editing is available at this time.  Creating barclamps is covered in the developer section at :reF:`barclamp_dev`.
