Provisioner
===========

Similarly to :ref:`ux_workload`, the "Provisioner" tab will not open a page, rather it will give three options: "Machines", "Boot Environment", and "Templates".


.. _ux_machines:

Machines
--------


The "Machines" page shows all of the physical machines that the user has access to read.  The page also allows the user to examine each machine in use.

**Note:** The bar color of the machine corresponds to it's level of activeness: Blue is 100% responsive, yellow is partially responsive, and black is off.

.. _ux_boot_environment:

Boot Environment
----------------

The "Boot Environment" page logs the available boot environments.

The page also provides the user with the ability to examine each environment.  In the expanded view for each environment, they can be edited and deleted.

The "Templates" page shows all of the available default templates.  The page also allows for the addition of specialized templates.
