DHCP Subnet
===========

The "DHCP Subnet" page shows network configurations. The page shows the network name and the subnet that is employed by the network. The DHCP also provides IP addresses that to be leased or bound to nodes. The leased and bound nodes and IPs can be seen on the page, along with options for the DHCP.

**Extra Info:** DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is used to hand out addressed to admin networks, and also tells the nodes to boot OS's from the provisioner.
