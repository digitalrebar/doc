Adding Roles
------------

Roles can be added in multiple ways, one such way is through the deployments page. After opening a deployment, open the "propose" menu at the bottom of the page. From there press the "Add Roles" button, which should be the circular one. Then select the desired role from the list. 

Roles can also be added through deployment roles.
