UX

The UX container provides an experimental UI that attempts to address real time feedback, scale, and
configuration, while also monitoring the :ref:`arch_service_provisioner` services.

The UX registers with the :ref:`arch_service_revproxy` as the /ux directory reference from the :ref:`arch_other_systems`.
