Attribute Injection
-------------------

Attribute Injection is an essential aspect of the "FuncOps" story
because it helps clean boundaries needed to implement consistent
scripting behavior between divergent sites.

It also allows Digital Rebar to abstract and isolate provisioning layers. This
operational approach means that deployments are composed of layered
services (see emergent services) instead of locked "golden" images. The
layers can be maintained independently and allow users to compose
specific configurations *a la carte*. This approach works if the layers
have clean functional boundaries (FuncOps) that can be scoped and
managed atomically.

To explain how Attribute Injection accomplishes this, we need to explore
why search became an anti-pattern in Crowbar v1. Originally, being able to
use server based search functions in operational scripting was a
critical feature. It allowed individual nodes to act as part of a system
by searching for global information needed to make local decisions. This
greatly added Crowbar's mission of system level configuration; however, it
also created significant hidden interdependencies between scripts. As
Crowbar v1 grew in complexity, searches became more and more difficult to
maintain because they were difficult to correctly scope, hard to
centrally manage and prone to timing issues.

    Digital Rebar was not unique in dealing with this problem - the Attribute
    Injection pattern has become a preferred alternative to search in
    integrated community cookbooks.

Attribute Injection in Digital Rebar works by establishing specific
inputs and outputs for all state actions (NodeRole runs). By declaring
the exact inputs needed and outputs provided, Digital Rebar can better manage
each annealing operation. This control includes deployment scoping
boundaries, time sequence of information plus override and substitution
of inputs based on execution paths.

This concept is *not* unique to Digital Rebar. It has become best practice for
operational scripts. Digital Rebar simply extends to paradigm to the system
level and orchestration level.

Attribute Injection enabled operations to be:

-  Atomic - only the information needed for the operation is provided so
   risk of "bleed over" between scripts is minimized. This is also a
   functional programming preference.

-  Isolated Idempotent - risk of accidentally picking up changed
   information from previous runs is reduced by controlling the inputs.
   That makes it more likely that scripts can be idempotent.

-  Cleanly Scoped - information passed into operations can be limited
   based on system deployment boundaries instead of search parameters.
   This allows the orchestration to manage when and how information is
   added into configurations.

-  Easy to troubleshoot - since the information is limited and
   controlled, it is easier to recreate runs for troubleshooting. This
   is a substantial value for diagnostics.
