What is actual Rebar?
=====================

We feel strongly about the rebar and reinforced data center analogy.

`Rebar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar>`_ is steel (metal) that is embedded into `reinforced concrete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforced_concrete>`_ to make it structurally durable.  It was an essential innovation that allows building cloudscraping towers and more robust infrastructure.

Digital rebar provides a similar underlaying framework to reinforce data centers.

Additional notes about (re)bar
------------------------------

Rebar is also a nod to our Crowbar history.  The project founders were the original Crowbar founders.  In very practical terms, the Digital Rebar project is a reimagined implementation of Crowbar.

Rebar also works as a reference to the "bare metal" physical infrastructure that Digital Rebar focused on automating.
