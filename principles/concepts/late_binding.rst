Ops Late Binding
================

In terms of computer science languages, late binding describes a class
of 4th generation languages that do not require programmers to know all
the details of the information they will store until the data is
actually stored. Historically, computers required very exact and
prescriptive data models, but later generation languages embraced a more
flexible binding.

Ops is fluid and situational.

Many DevOps tooling leverages eventual consistency to create stable
deployments. This interative approach assumes that repeated attempts of
executing the same idemnepotent scripts do deliver this result; however,
they do not deliver predictable upgrades in situations where there
are circular dependencies to resolve.

Its not realistic to predict the exact configuration of a system in
advance â€“

-  the operational requirements recursively impact how the
   infrastructure is configured
-  ops environments must be highly dynamic
-  resilience requires configurations to be change tolerant

Even more complex upgrade where the steps cannot be determined in
advanced because the specifics of the deployment direct the upgrade.
