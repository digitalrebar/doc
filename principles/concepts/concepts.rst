The Operations Challenge
------------------------

A deployment framework is key to solving the problems of deploying,
configuring, and scaling clusters for cloud computing.

Deploying a cloud or cluster of containers or bare metal server clusters can be a complex undertaking. Manual
processes can take days or even weeks working to get a cluster fully
operational. Even then, the infrastructure is never static, in the real world clusters of
solutions are constantly on an upgrade or improvement path. There is a
continuous need to deploy new servers, add management capabilities, and
track the upstream releases, while keeping the cloud or cluster running, and
providing reliable services to end users. Service continuity
requirements dictate a need for automation and orchestration. There is
no other way to reduce the cost while improving the uptime reliability
of a cloud.

These were among the challenges that drove the development of the
Digital Rebar software framework from it's roots as an
`OpenStack <http://OpenStack.org>`__ installer (Crowbar) into a much broader
orchestration platform. Because of this evolution, Digital Rebar has a
number of architectural features to address these challenges:

-  Abstraction Around Orchestration

   Digital Rebar is designed to simplify the operations of large scale
   infrastructure by providing a higher level abstraction on top
   of existing configuration management and orchestration tools based on
   a layered deployment model.

-  Web Architecture

   Digital Rebar is implemented as a web application server, with a full
   user interface and a predictable and consistent REST API.

-  Platform Agnostic Implementation

   Digital Rebar is designed to be platform and operating system
   agnostic. It supports discovery and provisioning from a bare metal
   state, including hardware configuration, updating and configuring
   BIOS and BMC boards, and operating system installation. Multiple
   operating systems and heterogeneous operating systems are supported.
   Digital Rebar enables use of time-honored tools, industry standard
   tools, and any form of scriptable facility to perform its state
   transition operations.

-  Modular Architecture

   Digital Rebar is designed around modular plug-ins called Barclamps.
   Barclamps allow for extensibility and customization while
   encapsulating layers of deployment in manageable units.

-  State Transition Management Engine

   The core of Digital Rebar is based on a state machine that tracks
   nodes, roles, and their relationships in groups called deployments.
   The state machine is responsible for analyzing dependencies and
   scheduling state transition operations (transitions).

-  Data Model

   Digital Rebar uses a dedicated database to track system state and
   data. As discovery and deployment progresses, system data is
   collected and made available to other components in the system.
   Individual components can access and update this data, reducing
   dependencies through a combination of deferred binding and runtime
   attribute injection.

-  Network Abstraction

   Digital Rebar is designed to support a flexible network abstraction,
   where physical interfaces, BMC's, VLANS, binding, teaming, and other
   low level features are mapped to logical conduits, which can be
   referenced by other components. Networking configurations can be
   created dynamically to adapt to changing infrastructure.
