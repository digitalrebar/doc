Jig (aka CMDB interface) APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jigs are the interface between Digital Rebar and doing work in the
infrastructure.

System Jigs
^^^^^^^^^^^

Digital Rebar has three built-in jigs

-  Script - uses SSH to perform operations on nodes.  This is used for
   bootstrapping actions that install the agents for other Jigs.  Not
   activated in development mode.
-  Noop (no operation) - takes internal actions in Digital Rebar only.
   Used when database updates or coordination points are needed that
   have no external action.
-  Test - used by the test infrastructure to validate Digital Rebar
   logic when no physical infrastructure is available.  Not activated in
   production mode.
