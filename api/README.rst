Digital Rebar APIs
------------------

This document is the reference guide for the Digital Rebar API.

Our intention is to keep the API documentation focused on using
the API and leave more to curious readers to review the model and
principles areas.

Digital Rebar has multiple APIs.  The Core API drives the data model and orchestration.  The Service APIs provide optional services that support data center infrastructure.
