User Interface Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rebar uses the basic Rails MVC approach for UI development with some
small AJAX extension.

While there are more sophisticated and scalable models, the development
team feels that Rails MVC provides sufficient experience without
additional complexity.  Maintainability and simplicity of the UI are
primary goals at this point.

We expect to revisit this assumption in the future and encourage
community development of this UI or other approaches.
