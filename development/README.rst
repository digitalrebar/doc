Dev Environment
---------------

Our development environments include a *working* administrative server
for testing. It is very important in our process that developers are
able to run deployments in their environment as part of the testing
cycle.

Protip: The Rails Console can be entered from the host, using ``docker exec -it compose_rebar_api_1 /opt/digitalrebar/core/tools/rails-console.sh``.  This works for development and production!

Setting Rails Development Mode
------------------------------

Digital Rebar does not use RAILS_ENV= development in the traditional way because most of our testing is targeted at doing real provisioning work that requires the production system.

If development behavior is required (classes and views the refresh when code changes) then perform the following steps:

#. Deploy Digital Rebar normally.
#. From the host, create the ``dev.mode`` file in the digitalrebar home directory and restart the rebar_api contain::

      touch ~/digitalrebar/dev.mode
      cd ~/digitalrebar/deploy/compose && docker-compose restart rebar_api

Rails configuration changes can be made by created a personal ``core/rails/config/environments/production.rb`` file.  Please be certain to leave ``production.rb`` out of any pull requests.
