Connecting to the BMC Network
-----------------------------

By default, Digital Rebar sets up a BMC network on 192.168.128.xxx/24 named
``the_bmc`` in the category ``bmc`` and the group ``internal``.  The presets may be modified by changing values from the ``/networks`` page.
These instructions have been created assuming the use of the default network and must be modified to match any special configurations.
