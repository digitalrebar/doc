Pre-Install Configuration
-------------------------

There are a set of configuration options that can be set before running the deploy tools.  These modify the start up and options available in the running Digital Rebar admin server.  Many of these options and values can be modified post deployment.  However, it is easier to set configurations initially, therefore allowing for more simple rebuilding and development in the future.

**Note**: If you are able to reset without distrupting your environment, we highly recommend rebuilding/reinstalling with updated initial configurations to ensure that you can fully recreate your Digital Rebar environment in new locations.  Otherwise, please make sure you note changes made during bring-up.

Once the system is running, see :ref:`dg_post_config` for updates.
