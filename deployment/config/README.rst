Post-Install Configuration
--------------------------

If you have not set-up Digital Rebar yet, please check the :ref:`dg_pre_config` for options available before the system is started.

Digital Rebar has many options for adjusting the system post-installation.  In many cases, pre-configuration mistakes can also be corrected post-configuration.
