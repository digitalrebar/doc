Deployment Guide
----------------

This guide contains information on how to deploy and setup a Digital Rebar environment.  Once the environment is setup, the next steps can be found
in the :ref:`user_guide`.

The deployment guide provides four parts:

#. Deciding what and where to deploy
#. Getting the deployment tools
#. Tweaking configuration for initial bring up and beyond
#. Running tools to do deployment

Walk through each section to deploy a Digital Rebar admin node. As always, there is a  ``tl;dr`` found at :ref:`quick_start`.
