bios-supermicro-configure is the low level BIOS config role for all
systems that are configurable by SuperMicro Update Manager.  This includes
most systems sold by SuperMicro through various OEMs.

In order to use this role, you must provide a copy of SuperMicro Update
Manager, which is licensed and purchasable from SuperMicro or from your OEM.

Additionally, the systems must be activated and licensed to be managed by SuperMicro.
Most OEMs will activate the licenses on the system before shipping if the
licensed was purchased from the system.
